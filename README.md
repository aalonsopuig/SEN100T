**Advanced temperature datalogger**

August 2015. Designed by Alejandro Alonso. 
 
---

SEN100T is a compact system, an advanced graphic datalogger for multiple measurement of temperature variations, prepared to measure up to six different temperature points, with values between -55⁰C and 125⁰C, admitting temperature variations of 6⁰C per second. The samples taken are represented on the built-in TFT screen, are stored on removable SD memory and can be transferred via USB in real time. An indispensable instrumentation for laboratories and research departments among others.

This is a fully finished and functional product.
